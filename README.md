The schema.sql file and PNG were both generated from https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/

schema.sql is the code to generate tables and schema.png is a the entity relationship drawing

For the data anlysis, I saved my queries as queries.sql and saved the results from the queries
as csv files in the data anlysis answers folder

To create the database, I ran schema.sql to generate the tables and then imported the CSVs from the data folder 
into Postgres

For my queries to answer the data anlysis, I used a few outside sources also listed in the queries.sql file

--between query from

--frequency query from
